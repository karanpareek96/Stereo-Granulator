# Stereo-Granulator-in-MATLAB

# Abstract

A transition from analog processing to digital computing has seen the emergence of numerous sound synthesis models. Efficieny in algorithms on digital platforms like C++ and MATLAB have aided in expanding the boundries of audio synthesis. This paper provides an overview of Granular Synthesis, a concept explored by Curtis Roads in his pivotal work, Microsound (2001), and its subsequent implementation in MATLAB. By defining the various time scales for audio representation, Roads introduced a technique of sound synthesis that employs the use of short grains of sounds, the parameters of which can be set to yield a multitude of possibilities. Refining Roads’ approach, author Udo Zolzer, in his book DAFX: Digital Audio Effects (2011), studied and formalized concepts about audio segmentation in the frequency and time domain that laid the foundation of modern granulation modules.

In adhering to the core concept proposed by Roads and Zoler, the MATLAB module makes use of matrix operations to achieve segmentation and rearrangement of audio grains. MATLAB emerges as a robust tool for signal processing tasks. The primary motivation behind the implementation of sound granulation on the MATLAB was the program’s efficiency in handling complex calculations through matrix operations. Not only are functions easy to understand and implement, but are intuitive in their functionality.
